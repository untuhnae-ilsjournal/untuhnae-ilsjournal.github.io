                A lot had happened between the middle of February and the end of March. The last few weeks have been extremely hectic. I was struggling with some personal issues, and the teachers' workload was a little too much for me. We needed to prepare for interviews, reports, and homework. However, some of our interviews and reporting were pushed back. We had a lot of liabilities, and I could feel myself turning into one. We have a group research project in our Inquiries, Investigations, and Immersion subject, and our group leader is doing the majority of the work. It made me nervous because I hadn't been laying in any effort on that particular activity, and our group leader appears to be doing all of the duties. Nonetheless, I pushed it to the back of my mind and went about my business. 
                </p>
                 <p style="text-indent:50px;" align="justify">
                 Our group met to plan our iLS project and assign assigned workloads to each member. Because this was a group project, we all agreed that this was a great plan. We were dismayed after more discussions and research revealed that the research portion of this project was quite difficult. Furthermore, we had agreed that in order to be effective, each of us would conduct extensive research and compile it. The group members agreed on this idea, and the discussion came to a close. The rest of the week flew by.
                </p>
                 <p style="text-indent:50px;" align="justify">
                 Our school's intramurals were held the last week of March. Some students reacted negatively to the school intramurals dubbed "Tagisan 2022." However, it is possible to conclude that it was a success. Tagisan 2022 took place from March 28 to April 1, 2022. I took a brief respite during the Tagisan events. Because I didn't participate in any activities, I was able to relax and unwind for a while. I regret not partaking in any events because doing so would have resulted in extra credit on examinations. Even so, I had a good week and pushed back any work I had planned. Despite feeling a little antsy while on vacation, I managed to keep my cool. I told myself I'd work on things over the weekend. I kept putting things off until the following week.
                </p>
                <p> The following week was the one I was most anxious about.</p>

<p><b>Depicted Song:</b> <i>"Liability" by Lorde from the Album "Melodrama"</i> </p>
<p><b>Textual Relevance of the Song: </b> </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;" align="justify">
<i>"Liability" was created in response to those who regretted "dancing in [her] storm," and she sings, "They say, 'You're a little much for me/You're a liability/You're a little much for me," her delivery thick with both pain and smirking self-awareness. "Liability" is Lorde at her most vulnerable, commencing with an undisclosed murmuring deep voice, a solitary piano, and a brief glimmer of organ. Whereas Lorde has certainly explored the abyss of her heart in the past, reducing the volume allows her to reveal a new vulnerability.
                    </i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:50px;" align="justify">
<i>Liability is a piece of music I listen to on a daily basis. I keep overanalyzing things in my head, and it's a scene I can't handle. I can relate this song to this entry because I had been a bother to one of my group leaders. I became a "pabigat," which I despise. I don't want to become like that on this iLS journey. But I can't get away from the fact that I've become reliant and lazy during the course of this entry.
