                After the school's event "Tagisan 2022" concluded, school resumed. I worked extra hard the week school resumed on creating a full-fledged powerpoint presentation for our General Chemistry report. We had to present "Chemical Kinetics" to our fellow students, and I was terrified. I had spent some of my sleepless nights studying, creating, and explaining our report in order for it to be good. I also had to prepare for an interview for our Work Immersion subject, which had been postponed until after Holy Week. I had planned ahead of time, but it was a letdown. I even had to rearrange things in my room to make it look more presentable. Because of the moving, I had ripped some of the mats. Nonetheless, I wanted to get the interview over with and relieve some of my anxiousness.

                Prior to this week, I began researching for the iLS Project. Procrastination was out of the question because the deadlines were getting closer and closer. My anxiety was having none of it and forced me to work my body off. After analyzing what needed to be done, I realized there was still a lot more to do. Writing a research paper is not an easy task. However, my paper is not the final paper that will be chosen. For maximum efficiency, our papers were going to be compiled. There was a lot more research to be done. First, I had to come up with research paper titles. The titles I came up with sounded strange, cringey, and unappealing. I was taken aback by the laziness I had displayed. My thoughts were jumbled, and I was having difficulty moving forward. Nonetheless, I persisted and progressed. Second, I needed to write an introduction or background for the research. Then I looked for articles and related literature to fill out the paper, but there was little to none for the project we were working on. I had anticipated this because this project was not well-known or mainstream. I then continued researching until I had a preliminary collection of materials.

                <p> I had been looking forward to the upcoming day. The day we manufacture the product. How will it turn out?</p>

<p><b>Depicted Song:</b> <i>"Zombie (English Ver.)" by  DAY6 (데이식스) from the Extended Play "The Book of Us : The Demon"</i> </p>
<p><b>Textual Relevance of the Song: </b> </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;" align="justify">
<i>"Zombie" is a song by Day6, a (male) k-pop band. Sungjin (Guitar), Wonpil (Keyboard), Jae (Guitar), Young K (Bass), and Dowoon make up the band (Drum). Sungjin, Jae, Wonpil, and Young K are the band's four singers. Zombie is best described as a rock ballad, leaning more towards the ballad side of that pairing. At first, it's a little dull. But once you get into it, you'll come to like it. I enjoyed how the track deviated from the regular pattern and framework, which was the polar opposite of the song's lyrics about being stuck in the same routine and thus becoming a zombie for living life on repeat. In this way, the rock hymn became quite distinctive. This song trained me that there are some situations and feelings in our lives that we must recognize before we can come up with a solution. Not every situation necessitates an answer. Sometimes we just need to feel it, to experience it, in order to be a better individual the next day. Genuinely, the song expresses how I felt as this project progressed. The song is relevant to the text because completing this project was difficult. The song taught me that I needed to face the project head on and keep pushing forward in order to have a successful overall result.
